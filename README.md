# FootyVision: AI-Powered Football Match Analysis

FootyVision is an advanced football match analysis system that utilizes cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to provide comprehensive insights into games.  This project combines computer vision libraries like OpenCV and object detection models such as YOLOv8 to track players, referees, and the ball throughout a match. It also provides in-depth analysis on ball possession, player movements, and team strategies.
Features

    Player, Referee, and Ball Tracking: Accurately identify and track players, referees, and the ball throughout a match video.
    Team Assignment: Assign players to their respective teams based on jersey colors.
    Ball Possession Analysis: Determine ball possession percentages for each team.
    Player Movement Tracking: Track individual player movements and calculate distances covered.
    Perspective Transformation: Convert the camera's distorted view into an accurate representation of the field for realistic player position tracking.
    Speed and Distance Calculation: Compute player speeds and total distance covered.

Getting Started

    Prerequisites:
        Python 3.x
        OpenCV
        Ultralytics (for YOLOv8)
        Numpy
        Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

    Installation:
    Bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/FootyVision.git
    cd FootyVision
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Use code with caution.

Data Preparation:

    Download a football match video (e.g., from the DFL Bundesliga Data Shootout on Kaggle).
    Place the video in the input_videos folder.
    If you want to fine-tune the YOLOv8 model, you can use a dataset like the "Football Player Detection Image Dataset" from Roboflow.

Usage:

    Run the main script:

Bash

python main.py

Use code with caution.

        The processed video with annotations and analysis will be saved in the output_videos folder.
